## Human-readable and Machine-readable

When writing open, reproducible scientific workflows, it is always
important to make sure that:

1.  all collaborators can understand whatâ€™s going on
2.  any commands you give to a computer are clear and unambiguous

We call these two (sometimes competing) goals **human-readability** and
**machine-readability**.

> 2. In the new cell, answer the following question in a Markdown
>     **quote**: Does this Jupyter Notebook file have a machine-readable
>     name? Explain your answer.

"This file does not have a machine-readable name. The name includes spaces and contains both upper and lower case text." 

> **Your task: Machine-readable file names**

> Rename any notebooks in this folder with an **expressive and
> machine-readable file name**
